I didn't see a task list in that comment. Remember, a task list starts with the syntax `- [ ] ` and then the task list item. The formatting is specific! Try again with a new comment. You can copy this one if you would like to see how they look:

```
- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world
```

If you would like assistance troubleshooting, create a post on the [GitHub Community]({{ communityBoard }}) board. You might also want to search for your issue to see if other people have resolved it in the past.
