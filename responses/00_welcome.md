### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight syntax for communicating on GitHub, and many other websites. You can format words as **bold** or _italic_, add images, and create lists. Markdown is regular text combined with a few non-alphabetic symbols, such as `#` or `*`. You can use Markdown with the formatting toolbar in issues <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#issues)</sup> and pull requests <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)</sup>, or you can type the syntax.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Comments in issues and pull requests (like this one!)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-gists)
