## Step 9: Use emphasis

Great job with those lists! Let's try something new. You can use **bold** and _italic_ text in Markdown. There are a couple of ways to create emphasis.

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```
