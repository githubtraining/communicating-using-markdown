## Step 6: Add a profile link

Your image looks great! Next, you'll want to add links to your awesome portfolio projects. Links help create context when youâ€™re communicating in issues and pull requests.

You might link to a [website](https://github.com/), a [repository](https://github.com/github/training-kit), or even a [line of code](https://github.com/github/training-kit/blob/master/resources/learning-path/index.html#L32). To create a link, put the text you want to display in square brackets, and the URL in the following parentheses.

```
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```
