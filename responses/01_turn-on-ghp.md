1. Under your repository name at the upper right, click [:gear: **Settings**]({{ repoUrl }}/settings).
2. Then on the lower left, click **Pages**
3. In the **GitHub Pages** section, use the **Select source** drop-down menu to select `main` as your GitHub Pages publishing source.
4. Click the **Save** button.
