### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Under your repository name, click [**Settings**]({{ repoUrl }}/settings).
1. In the **GitHub Pages** section, use the **Select source** drop-down menu to select `master` as your GitHub Pages publishing source.

> _I may take up to a minute to respond as I wait for GitHub Pages to create a deployment of your repository_.

> _For more information, see [Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) in the GitHub Help._
