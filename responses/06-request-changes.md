:thinking: I don't see any text with emphasis yet. To complete this exercise, you need to add some emphasized text to the `_includes/05-emphasis.md` file, in the form of a *bold* or _italicized_ words.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add emphasis

1. Click the "Files changed" tab
1. Scroll to find the `_includes/05-emphasis.md`
1. Click the :pencil: pencil icon
1. Add emphasis using `**` for **bold** or `_` for _italics_ (emphasis should not have a space between the markdown and the word to be modified)
1. Scroll to the bottom and commit your changes to your branch
